# Python notebook for calculating completeness magnitudes and b-values for earthquake catalogues

The [notebook](https://github.com/sachalapins/bvalues/blob/main/bvalues.ipynb) (bvalues.ipynb) in this repository is intended as a short (and hopefully helpful) guide to calculating the completeness magnitude and b-value for a catalogue of earthquakes.

See [notebook](https://github.com/sachalapins/bvalues/blob/main/bvalues.ipynb) for further details.
