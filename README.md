# Python notebook for calculating completeness magnitudes and b-values for earthquake catalogues

The notebook ([bvalues.ipynb](https://github.com/sachalapins/bvalues/blob/main/bvalues.ipynb)) in this repository is intended as a short (and hopefully helpful) guide to calculating the completeness magnitude and b-value for a catalogue of earthquakes.

See [bvalues.ipynb](https://github.com/sachalapins/bvalues/blob/main/bvalues.ipynb) for further details.

The earthquake catalogue is from the 2011-2012 post-eruptive period at Nabro volcano in Eritrea, taken from the paper by **Lapins et al. (2021)**, titled '*A Little Data Goes a Long Way: Automating Seismic Phase Arrival Picking at Nabro Volcano With Transfer Learning*' (https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB021910). Please cite this paper if using this data for any purpose. Again, see [bvalues.ipynb](https://github.com/sachalapins/bvalues/blob/main/bvalues.ipynb) for further details.
