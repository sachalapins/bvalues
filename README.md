# Python notebook for calculating completeness magnitudes and b-values for earthquake catalogues

The notebook ([bvalues.ipynb](https://github.com/sachalapins/bvalues/blob/main/bvalues.ipynb)) in this repository is intended as a short (and hopefully helpful) guide to calculating the completeness magnitude and b-value for a catalogue of earthquakes.

See [bvalues.ipynb](https://github.com/sachalapins/bvalues/blob/main/bvalues.ipynb) for further details.
